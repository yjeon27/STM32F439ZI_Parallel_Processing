# STM32F439ZI_Parallel_Process
## Implementing parallel processing over 3 STM32F439ZI development boards in SPI configuration for image processing algorithms*
- to be updated shortly

## :heavy_check_mark:i2c_noAPI
- i2c_detect() credits to https://github.com/ferenc-nemeth/stm32-i2cdetect
- finding slave address..

## (X) test 1, test 3 - I2C Across Two F439Zis Using ST API
- (error) undefined reference to extern... main.c, stm32f4xx_it.c

## (X) test 2 - SD Card Reader

## (X) alt_i2c, alt_i2c2 - Different API
